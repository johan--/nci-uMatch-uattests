#  Scenario: When the incoming patient trigger's dateCreated is older than the previous trigger for the same patient MATCHbox rejects the trigger
#    Given that Patient StudyID "<studyId>" PatientSeqNumber "<patient_id>" StepNumber "<stepNumber>" PatientStatus "<patientStatus>" Message "<message>" with "current" dateCreated is received from EA layer

#    Given that Patient StudyID "APEC1621" PatientSeqNumber "PT-Test8" StepNumber "1.0" PatientStatus "OFF_STUDY" Message "Patient with OFF_TRIAL message" with "older" dateCreated is received from EA layer
#    When posted to MATCH patient registration
#    Then a message "Incoming OFF_STUDY patient (PSN:PT-Test8) trigger has older date than the patient's registration date in the system" is returned with a "Failure"


  Scenario Outline: PT_RG06. Date created cannot be a future date
