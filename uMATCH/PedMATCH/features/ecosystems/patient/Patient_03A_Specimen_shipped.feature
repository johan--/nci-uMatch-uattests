    When post to MATCH patients service, returns a message that includes "processed successfully" with status "Success"
    Then patient field: "current_status" should have value: "TISSUE_NUCLEIC_ACID_SHIPPED" within 15 seconds
    Then patient should have variant report (analysis_id: "PT_SS27_VariantReportUploaded_ANI1") within 15 seconds
    And this variant report has value: "REJECTED" in field: "status"
